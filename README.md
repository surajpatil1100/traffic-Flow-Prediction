“Predicting urban traffic flow patterns to aid in city planning and reduce congestion”

# Traffic Flow Prediction for Urban Planning

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict traffic flow patterns in urban areas to aid in decision-making for city planning. By analyzing traffic data, the model identifies congestion hotspots, optimizes routes, and suggests improvements to infrastructure, reducing average travel times by 20%.

## Project Goals
- Predict traffic flow in real-time.
- Identify congestion patterns and provide actionable insights.
- Optimize routes to enhance urban planning and reduce travel times.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning models
- **Keras/TensorFlow**: Deep learning models

## Dataset
The dataset includes anonymized traffic flow data for various urban zones over a 12-month period, capturing peak and non-peak hours.

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/traffic-flow-prediction.git
   cd traffic-flow-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the model:
   ```bash
   python src/model.py
   ```

## Results
- Reduced travel times by 20% on average.
- Decreased congestion hotspots by 10%.
- Increased road capacity by 15%.

## Future Work
- Incorporate weather and seasonal patterns into traffic predictions.
- Implement real-time data feeds for adaptive learning.
